abstract = {MOTIVATION: The goal of neighborhood analysis is to find a set of genes (the neighborhood) that is similar to an initial 'seed' set of genes. Neighborhood analysis methods for network data are important in systems biology. If individual network connections are susceptible to noise, it can be advantageous to define neighborhoods on the basis of a robust interconnectedness measure, e.g. the topological overlap measure. Since the use of multiple nodes in the seed set may lead to more informative neighborhoods, it can be advantageous to define multi-node similarity measures.

RESULTS: The pairwise topological overlap measure is generalized to multiple network nodes and subsequently used in a recursive neighborhood construction method. A local permutation scheme is used to determine the neighborhood size. Using four network applications and a simulated example, we provide empirical evidence that the resulting neighborhoods are biologically meaningful, e.g. we use neighborhood analysis to identify brain cancer related genes.

These profiles are count-based and are assumed to follow a Binomial or Poisson distribution. However, tag counts observed across multiple libraries (for example, one or more groups of biological replicates) have additional variance that cannot be accommodated by this assumption alone. Several models have been proposed to account for this effect, all of which utilize a continuous prior distribution to explain the excess variance.

abstract = {Gene expression profiling (GEP) has stratified diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) into molecular subgroups that correspond to different stages of lymphocyte development-namely germinal center B-cell like and activated B-cell like. This classification has prognostic significance, but GEP is expensive and not readily applicable into daily practice, which has lead to immunohistochemical algorithms proposed as a surrogate for GEP analysis. We assembled tissue microarrays from 475 de novo DLBCL patients who were treated with rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy. All cases were successfully profiled by GEP on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Sections were stained with antibodies reactive with CD10, GCET1, FOXP1, MUM1 and BCL6 and cases were classified following a rationale of sequential steps of differentiation of B cells. Cutoffs for each marker were obtained using receiver-operating characteristic curves, obviating the need for any arbitrary method. An algorithm based on the expression of CD10, FOXP1 and BCL6 was developed that had a simpler structure than other recently proposed algorithms and 92.6\% concordance with GEP. In multivariate analysis, both the International Prognostic Index and our proposed algorithm were significant independent predictors of progression-free and overall survival. In conclusion, this algorithm effectively predicts prognosis of DLBCL patients matching GEP subgroups in the era of rituximab therapy.},

RESULTS: We demonstrate that updated probe set definitions provide both better precision and accuracy in probe set estimates compared to the original Affymetrix definitions. We show that the improved precision mainly depends on the increased number of probes that are integrated into each probe set, but we also demonstrate an improvement when the same number of probes is used. CONCLUSION: Updated probe set definitions does not only offer expression levels that are more accurately associated to genes and transcripts but also improvements in the estimated transcript expression levels. These results give support for the use of updated probe set definitions for analysis and meta-analysis of microarray data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in high-throughput technology has led to an increased amount of available data on protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Detecting and extracting functional modules that are common across multiple networks is an important step towards understanding the role of functional modules and how they have evolved across species. A global protein-protein interaction network alignment algorithm attempts to find such functional orthologs across multiple networks.

RESULTS: In this article, we propose a scalable global network alignment algorithm based on clustering methods and graph matching techniques in order to detect conserved interactions while simultaneously attempting to maximize the sequence similarity of nodes involved in the alignment. We present an algorithm for multiple alignments, in which several PPI networks are aligned. We empirically evaluated our algorithm on three real biological datasets with 6 different species and found that our approach offers a significant benefit both in terms of quality as well as speed over the current state-of-the-art algorithms.

CONCLUSION: Computational experiments on the real datasets demonstrate that our multiple network alignment algorithm is a more efficient and effective algorithm than the state-of-the-art algorithm, IsoRankN. From a qualitative standpoint, our approach also offers a significant advantage over IsoRankN for the multiple network alignment problem.},

@article{Langfelder2013,
abstract = {Since hub nodes have been found to play important roles in many networks, highly connected hub genes are expected to play an important role in biology as well. However, the empirical evidence remains ambiguous. An open question is whether (or when) hub gene selection leads to more meaningful gene lists than a standard statistical analysis based on significance testing when analyzing genomic data sets (e.g., gene expression or DNA methylation data). Here we address this question for the special case when multiple genomic data sets are available. This is of great practical importance since for many research questions multiple data sets are publicly available. In this case, the data analyst can decide between a standard statistical approach (e.g., based on meta-analysis) and a co-expression network analysis approach that selects intramodular hubs in consensus modules. We assess the performance of these two types of approaches according to two criteria. The first criterion evaluates the biological insights gained and is relevant in basic research. The second criterion evaluates the validation success (reproducibility) in independent data sets and often applies in clinical diagnostic or prognostic applications. We compare meta-analysis with consensus network analysis based on weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) in three comprehensive and unbiased empirical studies: (1) Finding genes predictive of lung cancer survival, (2) finding methylation markers related to age, and (3) finding mouse genes related to total cholesterol. The results demonstrate that intramodular hub gene status with respect to consensus modules is more useful than a meta-analysis p-value when identifying biologically meaningful gene lists (reflecting criterion 1). However, standard meta-analysis methods perform as good as (if not better than) a consensus network approach in terms of validation success (criterion 2). The article also reports a comparison of meta-analysis techniques applied to gene expression data and presents novel R functions for carrying out consensus network analysis, network based screening, and meta analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Network concepts are increasingly used in biology and genetics. For example, the clustering coefficient has been used to understand network architecture; the connectivity (also known as degree) has been used to screen for cancer targets; and the topological overlap matrix has been used to define modules and to annotate genes. Dozens of potentially useful network concepts are known from graph theory.

RESULTS: Here we study network concepts in special types of networks, which we refer to as approximately factorizable networks. In these networks, the pairwise connection strength (adjacency) between 2 network nodes can be factored into node specific contributions, named node 'conformity'. The node conformity turns out to be highly related to the connectivity. To provide a formalism for relating network concepts to each other, we define three types of network concepts: fundamental-, conformity-based-, and approximate conformity-based concepts. Fundamental concepts include the standard definitions of connectivity, density, centralization, heterogeneity, clustering coefficient, and topological overlap. The approximate conformity-based analogs of fundamental network concepts have several theoretical advantages. First, they allow one to derive simple relationships between seemingly disparate networks concepts. For example, we derive simple relationships between the clustering coefficient, the heterogeneity, the density, the centralization, and the topological overlap. The second advantage of approximate conformity-based network concepts is that they allow one to show that fundamental network concepts can be approximated by simple functions of the connectivity in module networks.

CONCLUSION: Using protein-protein interaction, gene co-expression, and simulated data, we show that a) many networks comprised of module nodes are approximately factorizable and b) in these types of networks, simple relationships exist between seemingly disparate network concepts. Our results are implemented in freely available R software code, which can be downloaded from the following webpage: http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/ModuleConformity/ModuleNetworks.},

@article{Yip2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Network methods are increasingly used to represent the interactions of genes and/or proteins. Genes or proteins that are directly linked may have a similar biological function or may be part of the same biological pathway. Since the information on the connection (adjacency) between 2 nodes may be noisy or incomplete, it can be desirable to consider alternative measures of pairwise interconnectedness. Here we study a class of measures that are proportional to the number of neighbors that a pair of nodes share in common. For example, the topological overlap measure by Ravasz et al. 1 can be interpreted as a measure of agreement between the m = 1 step neighborhoods of 2 nodes. Several studies have shown that two proteins having a higher topological overlap are more likely to belong to the same functional class than proteins having a lower topological overlap. Here we address the question whether a measure of topological overlap based on higher-order neighborhoods could give rise to a more robust and sensitive measure of interconnectedness.

RESULTS: We generalize the topological overlap measure from m = 1 step neighborhoods to m > or = 2 step neighborhoods. This allows us to define the m-th order generalized topological overlap measure (GTOM) by (i) counting the number of m-step neighbors that a pair of nodes share and (ii) normalizing it to take a value between 0 and 1. Using theoretical arguments, a yeast co-expression network application, and a fly protein network application, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed measure for module detection and gene neighborhood analysis.

CONCLUSION: Topological overlap can serve as an important filter to counter the effects of spurious or missing connections between network nodes. The m-th order topological overlap measure allows one to trade-off sensitivity versus specificity when it comes to defining pairwise interconnectedness and network modules.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many pathway analysis (or gene set enrichment analysis) methods have been developed to identify enriched pathways under different biological states within a genomic study. As more and more microarray datasets accumulate, meta-analysis methods have also been developed to integrate information among multiple studies. Currently, most meta-analysis methods for combining genomic studies focus on biomarker detection and meta-analysis for pathway analysis has not been systematically pursued.

RESULTS: We investigated two approaches of meta-analysis for pathway enrichment (MAPE) by combining statistical significance across studies at the gene level (MAPE\_G) or at the pathway level (MAPE\_P). Simulation results showed increased statistical power of meta-analysis approaches compared to a single study analysis and showed complementary advantages of MAPE\_G and MAPE\_P under different scenarios. We also developed an integrated method (MAPE\_I) that incorporates advantages of both approaches. Comprehensive simulations and applications to real data on drug response of breast cancer cell lines and lung cancer tissues were evaluated to compare the performance of three MAPE variations. MAPE\_P has the advantage of not requiring gene matching across studies. When MAPE\_G and MAPE\_P show complementary advantages, the hybrid version of MAPE\_I is generally recommended.

Its distinctive features include: (i) many different types of test statistics are allowed as input data, such as P-values, z-scores, correlations and t-scores; (ii) simultaneously, both local FDR and tail area-based FDR values are estimated for all test statistics and (iii) empirical null models are fit where possible, thereby taking account of potential over- or underdispersion of the theoretical null. In addition, 'fdrtool' provides readily interpretable graphical output, and can be applied to very large scale (in the order of millions of hypotheses) multiple testing problems. Consequently, 'fdrtool' implements a flexible FDR estimation scheme that is unified across different test statistics and variants of FDR.

To approximate the sampling distribution of the rank product statistic, the original publication proposed a permutation approach, whereas recently an alternative approximation based on the continuous gamma distribution was suggested. However, both approximations are imperfect for estimating small tail probabilities. In this paper we relate the rank product statistic to number theory and provide a derivation of its exact probability distribution and the true tail probabilities.},

abstract = {The combination of results from different large-scale datasets of multidimensional biological signals (such as gene expression profiling) presents a major challenge. Methodologies are needed that can efficiently combine diverse datasets, but can also test the extent of diversity (heterogeneity) across the combined studies. We developed METa-analysis of RAnked DISCovery datasets (METRADISC), a generalized meta-analysis method for combining information across discovery-oriented datasets and for testing between-study heterogeneity for each biological variable of interest. The method is based on non-parametric Monte Carlo permutation testing. The tested biological variables are ranked in each study according to the level of statistical significance. METRADISC tests for each biological variable of interest its average rank and the between-study heterogeneity of the study-specific ranks. After accounting for ties and differences in tested variables across studies, we randomly permute the ranks of each study and the simulated metrics of average rank and heterogeneity are calculated. The procedure is repeated to generate null distributions for the metrics. The use of METRADISC is demonstrated empirically using gene expression data from seven studies comparing prostate cancer cases and normal controls. We offer a new tool for combining complex datasets derived from massive testing, discovery-oriented research and for examining the diversity of results across the combined studies.},

abstract = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

The present work fills this gap. A general formula for the derivatives of the nodes and inner generators appearing in nested Archimedean copulas is developed. This leads to a tractable formula for the density of nested Archimedean copulas in arbitrary dimensions if the number of nesting levels is not too large. Various examples including famous Archimedean families and transformations of such are given. Furthermore, a numerically efficient way to evaluate the log-density is presented.},

Our approach aims to provide results in terms that are familiar to the analyst and easily interpreted by biologists. Moreover, by emphasizing resistant methods and not ignoring variability due to sampling, the approach aims to provide measures that speak to the repeatability of the results.},

abstract = {When the same set of genes appear in two top ranking gene lists in two different studies, it is often of interest to estimate the probability for this being a chance event. This overlapping probability is well known to follow the hypergeometric distribution. Usually, the lengths of top-ranking gene lists are assumed to be fixed, by using a pre-set criterion on, e.g., p-value for the t-test. We investigate how overlapping probability changes with the gene selection criterion, or simply, with the length of the top-ranking gene lists. It is concluded that overlapping probability is indeed a function of the gene list length, and its statistical significance should be quoted in the context of gene selection criterion.},

@article{Tewari2011a,
abstract = {In statistics, mixture models are used to characterize datasets with multimodal distributions. A class of mixture models called Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) has gained immense popularity among practitioners because of its sound statistical foundation and an efficient learning algorithm, which scales very well with both the dimension and the size of a dataset. However, the underlying assumption, that every mixing component is normally distributed, can often be too rigid for several real life datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new class of parametric mixture models that are based on Copula functions. The goal is to relax the assumption about the normality of mixing components. We formulate a class of functions called Gaussian Mixture Copula functions for the characterization of multi-modal distributions. The parameters of the proposed Gaussian Mixture Copula Model (GMCM) can be obtained in a Maximum-Likelihood setting. For this purpose, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a Gradient-based optimization algorithm are proposed. Owing to the non-convex log-likelihood function, only locally optimal solutions can be obtained. We also provide experimental evidence of the benefits of the GMCM over GMM using both synthetic and real-life datasets.},

abstract = {In cancer studies, it is common that multiple microarray experiments are conducted to measure the same clinical outcome and expressions of the same set of genes. An important goal of such experiments is to identify a subset of genes that can potentially serve as predictive markers for cancer development and progression. Analyses of individual experiments may lead to unreliable gene selection results because of the small sample sizes. Meta analysis can be used to pool multiple experiments, increase statistical power, and achieve more reliable gene selection. The meta analysis of cancer microarray data is challenging because of the high dimensionality of gene expressions and the differences in experimental settings amongst different experiments.},

@article{Hummel2006,
abstract = {Background The distinction between Burkitt’s lymphoma and diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. We used transcriptional and genomic profiling to define Burkitt’s lymphoma more precisely and to distinguish subgroups in other types of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Methods We performed gene-expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips with RNA from 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including a core group of 8 Burkitt’s lymphomas that met all World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A molecular signature for Burkitt’s lymphoma was generated, and chromosomal abnormalities were detected with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Results We used the molecular signature for Burkitt’s lymphoma to identify 44 cases: 11 had the morphologic features of diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas, 4 were unclassifiable mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and 29 had a classic or atypical Burkitt’s mor- phologic appearance. Also, five did not have a detectable IG-myc Burkitt’s translocation, whereas the others contained an IG-myc fusion, mostly in simple karyotypes. Of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular signature for Burkitt’s lymphoma, 155 were diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas. Of these 155 cases, 21 percent had a chromosomal breakpoint at the myc locus associated with complex chromosomal changes and an unfavorable clinical course. Conclusions Our molecular definition of Burkitt’s lymphoma clarifies and extends the spectrum of the WHO criteria for Burkitt’s lymphoma. In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a gene signature for Burkitt’s lymphoma, chromosomal breakpoints at the myc locus were associated with an adverse clinical outcome.},

@article{Ioannidis2005,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Here we report the massively parallel sequencing of 38 tumour genomes and their comparison to matched normal DNAs. Several new and unexpected oncogenic mechanisms were suggested by the pattern of somatic mutation across the data set. These include the mutation of genes involved in protein translation (seen in nearly half of the patients), genes involved in histone methylation, and genes involved in blood coagulation. In addition, a broader than anticipated role of NF-$\kappa$B signalling was indicated by mutations in 11 members of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Of potential immediate clinical relevance, activating mutations of the kinase BRAF were observed in 4\% of patients, suggesting the evaluation of BRAF inhibitors in multiple myeloma clinical trials. These results indicate that cancer genome sequencing of large collections of samples will yield new insights into cancer not anticipated by existing knowledge.},

abstract = {Microarrays are the most common method of studying global gene expression, and may soon enter the realm of FDA-approved clinical/diagnostic testing of cancer and other diseases. however, the acceptance of array data has been made difficult by the proliferation of widely different array platforms with gene probes ranging in size from 25 bases (oligonucleotides) to several kilobases (complementary DnAs or cDnAs). The algorithms applied for image and data analysis are also as varied as the microarray platforms, perhaps more so. in addition, there is a total lack of universally accepted standards for use among the different platforms and even within the same array types. Due to this lack of coherency in array technologies, confusion in interpretation of data within and across platforms has often been the norm, and studies of the same biological phenomena have, in many cases, led to contradictory results. in this commentary/review, some of the causes of this confusion will be sum- marized, and progress in overcoming these obstacles will be described, with the goal of providing an optimistic view of the future for the use of array technologies in global expression profiling and other applications.},

abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma is a mature aggressive B-cell lymphoma derived from germinal center B cells. Its cytogenetic hallmark is the Burkitt translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) and its variants, which juxtapose the MYC oncogene with one of the three immunoglobulin loci. Consequently, MYC is deregulated, resulting in massive perturbation of gene expression. Nevertheless, MYC deregulation alone seems not to be sufficient to drive Burkitt lymphomagenesis. By whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of four prototypical Burkitt lymphomas with immunoglobulin gene (IG)-MYC translocation, we identified seven recurrently mutated genes. One of these genes, ID3, mapped to a region of focal homozygous loss in Burkitt lymphoma. In an extended cohort, 36 of 53 molecularly defined Burkitt lymphomas (68\%) carried potentially damaging mutations of ID3. These were strongly enriched at somatic hypermutation motifs. Only 6 of 47 other B-cell lymphomas with the IG-MYC translocation (13\%) carried ID3 mutations. These findings suggest that cooperation between ID3 inactivation and IG-MYC translocation is a hallmark of Burkitt lymphomagenesis.},

GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates into an urgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining. One important problem is to identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules. However, existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time and space as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently, no efficient algorithm is available for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks.

RESULTS: We developed a novel algorithm, CODENSE, to efficiently mine frequent coherent dense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs. Compared with previous methods, our approach is scalable in the number and size of the input graphs and adjustable in terms of exact or approximate pattern mining. Applying CODENSE to 39 co-expression networks derived from microarray datasets, we discovered a large number of functionally homogeneous clusters and made functional predictions for 169 uncharacterized yeast genes.

@article{Dai2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing is a ubiquitous gene regulatory mechanism that dramatically increases the complexity of the proteome. However, the mechanism for regulating alternative splicing is poorly understood, and study of coordinated splicing regulation has been limited to individual cases. To study genome-wide splicing regulation, we integrate many human RNA-seq datasets to identify splicing module, which we define as a set of cassette exons co-regulated by the same splicing factors.

RESULTS: We have designed a tensor-based approach to identify co-splicing clusters that appear frequently across multiple conditions, thus very likely to represent splicing modules - a unit in the splicing regulatory network. In particular, we model each RNA-seq dataset as a co-splicing network, where the nodes represent exons and the edges are weighted by the correlations between exon inclusion rate profiles. We apply our tensor-based method to the 38 co-splicing networks derived from human RNA-seq datasets and indentify an atlas of frequent co-splicing clusters. We demonstrate that these identified clusters represent potential splicing modules by validating against four biological knowledge databases. The likelihood that a frequent co-splicing cluster is biologically meaningful increases with its recurrence across multiple datasets, highlighting the importance of the integrative approach.

CONCLUSIONS: Co-splicing clusters reveal novel functional groups which cannot be identified by co-expression clusters, particularly they can grant new insights into functions associated with post-transcriptional regulation, and the same exons can dynamically participate in different pathways depending on different conditions and different other exons that are co-spliced. We propose that by identifying splicing module, a unit in the splicing regulatory network can serve as an important step to decipher the splicing code.},

abstract = {Interactions between molecules are probabilistic events. An interaction may or may not happen with some probability, depending on a variety of factors such as the size, abundance, or proximity of the interacting molecules. In this paper, we consider the problem of aligning two biological networks. Unlike existing methods, we allow one of the two networks to contain probabilistic interactions. Allowing interaction probabilities makes the alignment more biologically relevant at the expense of explosive growth in the number of alternative topologies that may arise from different subsets of interactions that take place. We develop a novel method that efficiently and precisely characterizes this massive search space. We represent the topological similarity between pairs of aligned molecules (i.e., proteins) with the help of random variables and compute their expected values. We validate our method showing that, without sacrificing the running time performance, it can produce novel alignments. Our results also demonstrate that our method identifies biologically meaningful mappings under a comprehensive set of criteria used in the literature as well as the statistical coherence measure that we developed to analyze the statistical significance of the similarity of the functions of the aligned protein pairs.},

abstract = {Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) is a powerful 'guilt-by-association'-based method to extract coexpressed groups of genes from large heterogeneous messenger RNA expression data sets. We have utilized WGCNA to identify 11 coregulated gene clusters across 2342 breast cancer samples from 13 microarray-based gene expression studies. A number of these transcriptional modules were found to be correlated to clinicopathological variables (e.g. tumor grade), survival endpoints for breast cancer as a whole (disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival and overall survival) and also its molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2+ and basal-like). Examples of findings arising from this work include the identification of a cluster of proliferation-related genes that when upregulated correlated to increased tumor grade and were associated with poor survival in general. The prognostic potential of novel genes, for example, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2S (UBE2S) within this group was confirmed in an independent data set. In addition, gene clusters were also associated with survival for breast cancer molecular subtypes including a cluster of genes that was found to correlate with prognosis exclusively for basal-like breast cancer. The upregulation of several single genes within this coexpression cluster, for example, the potassium channel, subfamily K, member 5 (KCNK5) was associated with poor outcome for the basal-like molecular subtype. We have developed an online database to allow user-friendly access to the coexpression patterns and the survival analysis outputs uncovered in this study (available at http://glados.ucd.ie/Coexpression/).},

@article{Strimmer2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: False discovery rate (FDR) methods play an important role in analyzing high-dimensional data. There are two types of FDR, tail area-based FDR and local FDR, as well as numerous statistical algorithms for estimating or controlling FDR. These differ in terms of underlying test statistics and procedures employed for statistical learning.

RESULTS: A unifying algorithm for simultaneous estimation of both local FDR and tail area-based FDR is presented that can be applied to a diverse range of test statistics, including p-values, correlations, z- and t-scores. This approach is semipararametric and is based on a modified Grenander density estimator. For test statistics other than p-values it allows for empirical null modeling, so that dependencies among tests can be taken into account. The inference of the underlying model employs truncated maximum-likelihood estimation, with the cut-off point chosen according to the false non-discovery rate.

CONCLUSION: The proposed procedure generalizes a number of more specialized algorithms and thus offers a common framework for FDR estimation consistent across test statistics and types of FDR. In comparative study the unified approach performs on par with the best competing yet more specialized alternatives. The algorithm is implemented in R in the "fdrtool" package, available under the GNU GPL from http://strimmerlab.org/software/fdrtool/ and from the R package archive CRAN.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

abstract = {One of the computational challenges in plant systems biology is to accurately infer transcriptional regulation relationships based on correlation analyses of gene expression patterns. Despite several correlation methods that are applied in biology to analyze microarray data, concerns regarding the compatibility of these methods with the gene expression data profiled by high-throughput RNA transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology have been raised. These concerns are mainly due to the fact that the distribution of read counts in RNA-Seq experiments is different from that of fluorescence intensities in microarray experiments. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the existing correlation methods and, if necessary, introduction of novel methods into biology is appropriate. In this study, we compared four existing correlation methods used in microarray analysis and one novel method called the Gini correlation coefficient on previously published microarray-based and sequencing-based gene expression data in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and maize (Zea mays). The comparisons were performed on more than 11,000 regulatory relationships in Arabidopsis, including 8,929 pairs of transcription factors and target genes. Our analyses pinpointed the strengths and weaknesses of each method and indicated that the Gini correlation can compensate for the shortcomings of the Pearson correlation, the Spearman correlation, the Kendall correlation, and the Tukey's biweight correlation. The Gini correlation method, with the other four evaluated methods in this study, was implemented as an R package named rsgcc that can be utilized as an alternative option for biologists to perform clustering analyses of gene expression patterns or transcriptional network analyses.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: To illustrate an intuitive and statistically valid method for combining independent sources of evidence that yields a p-value for the complete evidence, and to apply it to the problem of detecting simultaneous matches to multiple patterns in sequence homology searches. RESULTS: In sequence analysis, two or more (approximately) independent measures of the membership of a sequence (or sequence region) in some class are often available. We would like to estimate the likelihood of the sequence being a member of the class in view of all the available evidence. An example is estimating the significance of the observed match of a macromolecular sequence (DNA or protein) to a set of patterns (motifs) that characterize a biological sequence family. An intuitive way to do this is to express each piece of evidence as a p-value, and then use the product of these p-values as the measure of membership in the family. We derive a formula and algorithm (QFAST) for calculating the statistical distribution of the product of n independent p-values. We demonstrate that sorting sequences by this p-value effectively combines the information present in multiple motifs, leading to highly accurate and sensitive sequence homology searches.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The proliferation of public data repositories creates a need for meta-analysis methods to efficiently evaluate, integrate and validate related datasets produced by independent groups. A t-based approach has been proposed to integrate effect size from multiple studies by modeling both intra- and between-study variation. Recently, a non-parametric 'rank product' method, which is derived based on biological reasoning of fold-change criteria, has been applied to directly combine multiple datasets into one meta study. Fisher's Inverse chi(2) method, which only depends on P-values from individual analyses of each dataset, has been used in a couple of medical studies. While these methods address the question from different angles, it is not clear how they compare with each other. RESULTS: We comparatively evaluate the three methods; t-based hierarchical modeling, rank products and Fisher's Inverse chi(2) test with P-values from either the t-based or the rank product method. A simulation study shows that the rank product method, in general, has higher sensitivity and selectivity than the t-based method in both individual and meta-analysis, especially in the setting of small sample size and/or large between-study variation. Not surprisingly, Fisher's chi(2) method highly depends on the method used in the individual analysis. Application to real datasets demonstrates that meta-analysis achieves more reliable identification than an individual analysis, and rank products are more robust in gene ranking, which leads to a much higher reproducibility among independent studies. Though t-based meta-analysis greatly improves over the individual analysis, it suffers from a potentially large amount of false positives when P-values serve as threshold. We conclude that careful meta-analysis is a powerful tool for integrating multiple array studies.},

Omic-scale data include DNA variations, transcriptom profiles, and RAomics. Selection of an appropriate approach for a data-integration task is problem dependent, primarily dictated by the information contained in the data. In situations where modeling of multiple raw datasets jointly might be extremely challenging due to their vast differences, rankings from each dataset would provide a commonality based on which results could be integrated. Aggregation of microRNA targets predicted from different computational algorithms is such a problem. Integration of results from multiple mRNA studies based on different platforms is another example that will be discussed. Formulating the problem of integrating ranked lists as minimizing an objective criterion, we explore the usage of a cross entropy Monte Carlo method for solving such a combinatorial problem. Instead of placing a discrete uniform distribution on all the potential solutions, an iterative importance sampling technique is utilized "to slowly tighten the net" to place most distributional mass on the optimal solution and its neighbors. Extensive simulation studies were performed to assess the performance of the method. With satisfactory simulation results, the method was applied to the microRNA and mRNA problems to illustrate its utility.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The reconstruction of gene networks from gene-expression microarrays is gaining popularity as methods improve and as more data become available. The reliability of such networks could be judged by the probability that a connection between genes is spurious, resulting from chance fluctuations rather than from a true biological relationship. RESULTS: Unlike the false discovery rate and positive false discovery rate, the decisive false discovery rate (dFDR) is exactly equal to a conditional probability without assuming independence or the randomness of hypothesis truth values. This property is useful not only in the common application to the detection of differential gene expression, but also in determining the probability of a spurious connection in a reconstructed gene network. Estimators of the dFDR can estimate each of three probabilities: (1) The probability that two genes that appear to be associated with each other lack such association. (2) The probability that a time ordering observed for two associated genes is misleading. (3) The probability that a time ordering observed for two genes is misleading, either because they are not associated or because they are associated without a lag in time. The first probability applies to both static and dynamic gene networks, and the other two only apply to dynamic gene networks.},

The 95\% limits of agreement, estimated by mean difference +/- 1.96 standard deviation of the differences, provide an interval within which 95\% of differences between measurements by the two methods are expected to lie. We describe how graphical methods can be used to investigate the assumptions of the method and we also give confidence intervals. We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.},

As a result it reduces the estimation variance while providing an interpretable final model.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-resolution copy-number (CN) analysis has in recent years gained much attention, not only for the purpose of identifying CN aberrations associated with a certain phenotype, but also for identifying CN polymorphisms. In order for such studies to be successful and cost effective, the statistical methods have to be optimized. We propose a single-array preprocessing method for estimating full-resolution total CNs. It is applicable to all Affymetrix genotyping arrays, including the recent ones that also contain non-polymorphic probes. A reference signal is only needed at the last step when calculating relative CNs. RESULTS: As with our method for earlier generations of arrays, this one controls for allelic crosstalk, probe affinities and PCR fragment-length effects. Additionally, it also corrects for probe sequence effects and co-hybridization of fragments digested by multiple enzymes that takes place on the latest chips. We compare our method with Affymetrix's CN5 method and the dChip method by assessing how well they differentiate between various CN states at the full resolution and various amounts of smoothing. Although CRMA v2 is a single-array method, we observe that it performs as well as or better than alternative methods that use data from all arrays for their preprocessing. This shows that it is possible to do online analysis in large-scale projects where additional arrays are introduced over time.},

@article{Binder2005,
abstract = {Gene expression analysis by means of microarrays is based on the sequence-specific binding of RNA to DNA oligonucleotide probes and its measurement using fluorescent labels. The binding of RNA fragments involving sequences other than the intended target is problematic because it adds a chemical background to the signal, which is not related to the expression degree of the target gene. The article presents a molecular signature of specific and nonspecific hybridization with potential consequences for gene expression analysis. We analyzed the signal intensities of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes of GeneChip microarrays to specify the effect of specific and nonspecific hybridization. We found that these events give rise to different relations between the PM and MM intensities as function of the middle base of the PM, namely a triplet-like (C > G approximately T > A > 0) and a duplet-like (C approximately T > 0 > G approximately A) pattern of the PM-MM log-intensity difference upon binding of specific and nonspecific RNA fragments, respectively. The systematic behavior of the intensity difference can be rationalized on the level of basepairings of DNA/RNA oligonucleotide duplexes in the middle of the probe sequence. Nonspecific binding is characterized by the reversal of the central Watson-Crick (WC) pairing for each PM/MM probe pair, whereas specific binding refers to the combination of a WC and a self-complementary (SC) pairing in PM and MM probes, respectively. The Gibbs free energy contribution of WC pairs to duplex stability is asymmetric for purines and pyrimidines of the PM and decreases according to C > G approximately T > A. SC pairings on the average only weakly contribute to duplex stability. The intensity of complementary MM introduces a systematic source of variation which decreases the precision of expression measures based on the MM intensities.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A major focus of current cancer research is to identify genes that can be used as markers for prognosis and diagnosis, and as targets for therapy. Microarray technology has been applied extensively for this purpose, even though it has been reported that the agreement between microarray platforms is poor. A critical question is: how can we best combine the measurements of matched genes across microarray platforms to develop diagnostic and prognostic tools related to the underlying biology? RESULTS: We introduce a statistical approach within a Bayesian framework to combine the microarray data on matched genes from three investigations of gene expression profiling of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and normal B cells (NBC) using three different microarray platforms, oligonucleotide arrays, cDNA arrays printed on glass slides and cDNA arrays printed on nylon membranes. Using this approach, we identified a number of genes that were consistently differentially expressed between CLL and NBC samples.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the introduction of microarray technology has had a profound impact on gene expression research. The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a resource that represents an important first step toward establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in clinical and regulatory settings.},

abstract = {Background: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, dox- orubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expres- sion signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. Methods: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression–based survival-predictor mod- el derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. Results: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures — termed “germinal-center B-cell,” “stromal-1,” and “stromal-2” — predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognosti- cally favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 sig- nature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. Conclusions: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

@article{Breitling2004,
abstract = {One of the main objectives in the analysis of microarray experiments is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed under two experimental conditions. This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results.},

abstract = {In higher eukaryotes, alternative splicing is a common mechanism for increasing transcriptome diversity. Affymetrix exon arrays were designed as a tool for monitoring the relative expression levels of hundreds of thousands of known and predicted exons with a view to detecting alternative splicing events. In this article, we have analyzed exon array data from many different human and mouse tissues and have uncovered a systematic relationship between transcript-fold change and alternative splicing as reported by the splicing index. Evidence from dilution experiments and deep sequencing suggest that this effect is of technical rather than biological origin and that it is driven by sequence features of the probes. This effect is substantial and results in a 12-fold overestimation of alternative splicing events in genes that are differentially expressed. By cross-species exon array comparison, we could further show that the systematic bias persists even across species boundaries. Failure to consider this effect in data analysis would result in the reproducible false detection of apparently conserved alternative splicing events. Finally, we have developed a software in R called COSIE (Corrected Splicing Indices for Exon arrays) that for any given set of new exon array experiments corrects for the observed bias and improves the detection of alternative splicing (available at www.fmi.ch/groups/gbioinfo).},

abstract = {Background The distinction between Burkitt’s lymphoma and diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is crucial because these two types of lymphoma require different treatments. We ex- amined whether gene-expression profiling could reliably distinguish Burkitt’s lym- phoma from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Methods Tumor-biopsy specimens from 303 patients with aggressive lymphomas were pro- filed for gene expression and were also classified according to morphology, immuno- histochemistry, and detection of the t(8;14) c-myc translocation. Results A classifier based on gene expression correctly identified all 25 pathologically veri- fied cases of classic Burkitt’s lymphoma. Burkitt’s lymphoma was readily distin- guished from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma by the high level of expression of c-myc target genes, the expression of a subgroup of germinal-center B-cell genes, and the low level of expression of major-histocompatibility-complex class I genes and nu- clear factor-$\kappa$B target genes. Eight specimens with a pathological diagnosis of dif- fuse large-B-cell lymphoma had the typical gene-expression profile of Burkitt’s lymphoma, suggesting they represent cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma that are difficult to diagnose by current methods. Among 28 of the patients with a molecular diag- nosis of Burkitt’s lymphoma, the overall survival was superior among those who had received intensive chemotherapy regimens instead of lower-dose regimens. Conclusions Gene-expression profiling is an accurate, quantitative method for distinguishing Burkitt’s lymphoma from diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.},

abstract = {A relatively high number of different subsets of B-cells are generated through the differentiation of early B-cell precursors into mature B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow (BM) and antigen-triggered maturation of germinal center B-cells into memory B-lymphocytes and plasmablasts in lymphoid tissues. These B-cell subpopulations, which are produced in the BM and lymphoid tissues, recirculate through peripheral blood (PB), into different tissues including mucosa and the BM, where long-living plasma cells produce antibodies. These circulating PB B-cells can be classified according to their maturation stage into i) immature/transitional, ii) na\"{\i}ve, and iii) memory B-lymphocytes, and iv) plasmablasts/plasma cells. Additionally, unique subsets of memory B-lymphocytes and plasmablasts/plasma cells can be identified based on their differential expression of unique Ig-heavy chain isotypes (e.g.: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA). In the present paper, we review recent data reported in the literature about the distribution, immunophenotypic and functional characteristics of these cell subpopulations, as well as their distribution in PB according to age and seasonal changes. Additional information is also provided in this regard based on the study of a population-based cohort of 600 healthy adults aged from 20 to 80 years, recruited in the Salamanca area in western Spain. Detailed knowledge of the distribution and traffic of B-cell subsets through PB mirrors the immune status of an individual subject and it may also contribute to a better understanding of B-cell disorders related to B-cell biology and homeostasis, such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL).},

We identified the expression of 333 known miRNAs, which is more than twice the number previously recognized in any tissue type. We further identified the expression of 286 candidate novel miRNAs in normal and malignant B cells. These miRNAs were validated at a high rate (92\%) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and we demonstrated their application in the distinction of clinically relevant subgroups of lymphoma. We further demonstrated that a novel miRNA cluster, previously annotated as a hypothetical gene LOC100130622, contains 6 novel miRNAs that regulate the transforming growth factor-$\beta$ pathway. Thus, our work suggests that more than a third of the miRNAs present in most cellular types are currently unknown and that these miRNAs may regulate important cellular functions.},

abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

abstract = {A compound graph is a frequently encountered type of data set. Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.},

abstract = {We suggest a method for estimating a covariance matrix on the basis of a sample of vectors drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. In particular, we penalize the likelihood with a lasso penalty on the entries of the covariance matrix. This penalty plays two important roles: it reduces the effective number of parameters, which is important even when the dimension of the vectors is smaller than the sample size since the number of parameters grows quadratically in the number of variables, and it produces an estimate which is sparse. In contrast to sparse inverse covariance estimation, our method's close relative, the sparsity attained here is in the covariance matrix itself rather than in the inverse matrix. Zeros in the covariance matrix correspond to marginal independencies; thus, our method performs model selection while providing a positive definite estimate of the covariance. The proposed penalized maximum likelihood problem is not convex, so we use a majorize-minimize approach in which we iteratively solve convex approximations to the original nonconvex problem. We discuss tuning parameter selection and demonstrate on a flow-cytometry dataset how our method produces an interpretable graphical display of the relationship between variables. We perform simulations that suggest that simple elementwise thresholding of the empirical covariance matrix is competitive with our method for identifying the sparsity structure. Additionally, we show how our method can be used to solve a previously studied special case in which a desired sparsity pattern is prespecified.},

abstract = {We address covariance estimation in the sense of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for Gaussian samples. Specifically, we consider shrinkage methods which are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples (large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) method by conditioning on a sufficient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this yields a new estimator called RBLW, whose mean-squared error dominates that of LW for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle approximating shrinkage (OAS) estimator. Both RBLW and OAS estimators have simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are developed from different persepctives, their structure is identical up to specified constants. The RBLW estimator provably dominates the LW method. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the OAS approach can perform even better than RBLW, especially when n is much less than p. We also demonstrate the performance of these techniques in the context of adaptive beamforming.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma after chemotherapy is influenced by molecular features of the tumors. We used the gene-expression profiles of these lymphomas to develop a molecular predictor of survival. METHODS: Biopsy samples of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma from 240 patients were examined for gene expression with the use of DNA microarrays and analyzed for genomic abnormalities. Subgroups with distinctive gene-expression profiles were defined on the basis of hierarchical clustering. A molecular predictor of risk was constructed with the use of genes with expression patterns that were associated with survival in a preliminary group of 160 patients and was then tested in a validation group of 80 patients. The accuracy of this predictor was compared with that of the international prognostic index. RESULTS: Three gene-expression subgroups--germinal-center B-cell-like, activated B-cell-like, and type 3 diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma--were identified. Two common oncogenic events in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, bcl-2 translocation and c-rel amplification, were detected only in the germinal-center B-cell-like subgroup. Patients in this subgroup had the highest five-year survival rate. To identify other molecular determinants of outcome, we searched for individual genes with expression patterns that correlated with survival in the preliminary group of patients. Most of these genes fell within four gene-expression signatures characteristic of germinal-center B cells, proliferating cells, reactive stromal and immune cells in the lymph node, or major-histocompatibility-complex class II complex. We used 17 genes to construct a predictor of overall survival after chemotherapy. This gene-based predictor and the international prognostic index were independent prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: DNA microarrays can be used to formulate a molecular predictor of survival after chemotherapy for diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.},

Data on the prognostic role of CCNE in the 'rituximab (R)-era' are lacking. METHODS: To test reproducibility and applicability of observations from the 'pre-R era' to the 'R era', we examined the prognostic role of CCNE expression by immunohistochemistry in 1579 DLBCL on tissue microarrays (TMA); 339 patients were treated by CHOP and 635 by R-CHOP. RESULTS: 1209 samples (77\%) were evaluable; failures were due to missing TMA punches and fixation artefacts. Mean expression of CCNE was 13\% (0-85\%); applying a cut-off of >16\%, 382 DLBCL (31\%) were positive. CCNE did not correlate with any of the known variables (IPI, primary site, cell of origin, proliferation, and BCL2- or C-MYC rearrangements). We were able to reproduce data suggesting an IPI- and response to therapy independent, negative prognostic impact of CCNE in CHOP-treated DLBCL patients: CCNE-positive cases had a median survival of 16 months compared with 57 months in negative ones (p=0.012). In R-CHOP-treated patients the prognostic impact of CCNE was abrogated and only IPI, cell of origin and response to therapy had a prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of R to CHOP overcomes the negative prognostic impact of CCNE in DLBCL. Thus, R not only prolongs survival in DLBCL but also serves a cautionary note that prognostic factors should not be transferred into the 'R era' without proper scientific studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. Gene expression profiling studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment affects survival and that the angiogenesis-related signature is prognostically unfavorable. The contribution of histopathological microvessel density to survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas treated with immunochemotherapy remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to assess the prognostic impact of histopathological microvessel density in two independent series of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with immunochemotherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-seven patients from the Leukemia Lymphoma Molecular Profiling Project (training series) and 118 patients from the Catalan Lymphoma-Study group-GELCAB (validation cohort) were included in the study. Microvessels were immunostained with CD31 and quantified with a computerized image analysis system. The stromal scores previously defined in 110 Leukemia Lymphoma Molecular Profiling Project cases were used to analyze correlations with microvessel density data. RESULTS: Microvessel density significantly correlated with the stromal score (r=0.3209; P<0.001). Patients with high microvessel density showed significantly poorer overall survival than those with low microvessel density both in the training series (4-year OS 54\% vs. 78\%; P=0.004) and in the validation cohort (57\% vs. 81\%; P=0.006). In multivariate analysis, in both groups high microvessel density was a statistically significant unfavorable prognostic factor independent of international prognostic index [training series: international prognostic index (relative risk 2.7; P=0.003); microvessel density (relative risk 1.96; P=0.002); validation cohort: international prognostic index (relative risk 4.74; P<0.001); microvessel density (relative risk 2.4; P=0.016)]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the impact of angiogenesis in the outcome of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and the interest of evaluating antiangiogenic drugs in clinical trials.},

abstract = {The Affymetrix GeneChip is a popular microarray platform for genome-wide expression profiling and has been widely used in functional genomics especially in the classification of cancers. Due to the updating of genome data, much of the genome information with which the chips were designed is out-of-date and it has been reported that many of the genes/transcripts on the chips differ from their original definition when mapping the probes to the new genome information. Dai et al. have reported that the updated definition can cause as much as 30-50\% discrepancy in the genes selected as differentially expressed on a heart tissue expression profiling dataset. Understanding the nature of this difference is therefore very important for the utilization of the data. In this work, with a large cancer dataset as an example, we compared two major definitions and investigated their effects on classification, clustering, discovery of differentially expressed genes and gene-set-based analysis. Results show that the two definitions agree well on clustering and classification results but genes and gene sets discovered as differentially expressed or enriched can be very different. Discoveries based on the Affymetrix definition can cover most of those based on the new definition, but tend to have more false positives.},

abstract = {Gaussian graphical models explore dependence relationships between random variables, through the estimation of the corresponding inverse covariance matrices. In this paper we develop an estimator for such models appropriate for data from several graphical models that share the same variables and some of the dependence structure. In this setting, estimating a single graphical model would mask the underlying heterogeneity, while estimating separate models for each category does not take advantage of the common structure. We propose a method that jointly estimates the graphical models corresponding to the different categories present in the data, aiming to preserve the common structure, while allowing for differences between the categories. This is achieved through a hierarchical penalty that targets the removal of common zeros in the inverse covariance matrices across categories. We establish the asymptotic consistency and sparsity of the proposed estimator in the high-dimensional case, and illustrate its performance on a number of simulated networks. An application to learning semantic connections between terms from webpages collected from computer science departments is included.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of differential expressed genes has led to countless new discoveries. However, differentially expressed genes are only a proxy for finding dysregulated pathways. The problem is to identify how the network of regulatory and physical interactions rewires in different conditions or in disease.

RESULTS: We developed a procedure named DINA (DIfferential Network Analysis), which is able to identify set of genes, whose co-regulation is condition-specific, starting from a collection of condition-specific gene expression profiles. DINA is also able to predict which transcription factors (TFs) may be responsible for the pathway condition-specific co-regulation. We derived 30 tissue-specific gene networks in human and identified several metabolic pathways as the most differentially regulated across the tissues. We correctly identified TFs such as Nuclear Receptors as their main regulators and demonstrated that a gene with unknown function (YEATS2) acts as a negative regulator of hepatocyte metabolism. Finally, we showed that DINA can be used to make hypotheses on dysregulated pathways during disease progression. By analyzing gene expression profiles across primary and transformed hepatocytes, DINA identified hepatocarcinoma-specific metabolic and transcriptional pathway dysregulation.

AVAILABILITY: We implemented an on-line web-tool http://dina.tigem.it enabling the user to apply DINA to identify tissue-specific pathways or gene signatures.

abstract = {We have carried out weighted gene co-expression network analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to gain insights into gene expression architecture during log phase growth. The differentially expressed genes between at least one pair of 11 different M. tuberculosis strains as source of biological variability were used for co-expression network analysis. This data included genes with highest coefficient of variation in expression. Five distinct modules were identified using topological overlap based clustering. All the modules together showed significant enrichment in biological processes: fatty acid biosynthesis, cell membrane, intracellular membrane bound organelle, DNA replication, Quinone biosynthesis, cell shape and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, ribosome and structural constituents of ribosome and transposition. We then extracted the co-expressed connections which were supported either by transcriptional regulatory network or STRING database or high edge weight of topological overlap. The genes trpC, nadC, pitA, Rv3404c, atpA, pknA, Rv0996, purB, Rv2106 and Rv0796 emerged as top hub genes. After overlaying this network on the iNJ661 metabolic network, the reactions catalyzed by 15 highly connected metabolic genes were knocked down in silico and evaluated by Flux Balance Analysis. The results showed that in 12 out of 15 cases, in 11 more than 50\% of reactions catalyzed by genes connected through co-expressed connections also had altered fluxes. The modules 'Turquoise', 'Blue' and 'Red' also showed enrichment in essential genes. We could map 152 of the previously known or proposed drug targets in these modules and identified 15 new potential drug targets based on their high degree of co-expressed connections and strong correlation with module eigengenes.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

Gene expression data have revolutionized the study of diseases by making it possible to simultaneously consider thousands of genes. The identification of disease-associated genes requires studying the genes in the context of the regulatory systems they are involved in. A major goal is to identify specific regulatory networks that are dysfunctional in a given disease state. Although we still have not reached a stage where the elucidation of differential regulatory networks is commonly feasible, recent advances have described the first steps towards this goal - the identification of differential coexpression networks. This review describes the shift from differential gene expression to differential networking and outlines how this shift will affect the study of the genetic basis of disease.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Significant efforts have been made to acquire data under different conditions and to construct static networks that can explain various gene regulation mechanisms. However, gene regulatory networks are dynamic and condition-specific; under different conditions, networks exhibit different regulation patterns accompanied by different transcriptional network topologies. Thus, an investigation on the topological changes in transcriptional networks can facilitate the understanding of cell development or provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of certain diseases, and help identify the key genetic players that could serve as biomarkers or drug targets.

RESULTS: Here, we report a differential dependency network (DDN) analysis to detect statistically significant topological changes in the transcriptional networks between two biological conditions. We propose a local dependency model to represent the local structures of a network by a set of conditional probabilities. We develop an efficient learning algorithm to learn the local dependency model using the Lasso technique. A permutation test is subsequently performed to estimate the statistical significance of each learned local structure. In testing on a simulation dataset, the proposed algorithm accurately detected all the genes with network topological changes. The method was then applied to the estrogen-dependent T-47D estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell line datasets and human and mouse embryonic stem cell datasets. In both experiments using real microarray datasets, the proposed method produced biologically meaningful results. We expect DDN to emerge as an important bioinformatics tool in transcriptional network analyses. While we focus specifically on transcriptional networks, the DDN method we introduce here is generally applicable to other biological networks with similar characteristics.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genes and proteins are organized into functional modular networks in which the network context of a gene or protein has implications for cellular function. Highly connected hub proteins, largely responsible for maintaining network connectivity, have been found to be much more likely to be essential for yeast survival.

RESULTS: Here we investigate the properties of weighted gene co-expression networks formed from multiple microarray datasets. The constructed networks approximate scale-free topology, but this is not universal across all datasets. We show strong positive correlations between gene connectivity within the whole network and gene essentiality as well as gene sequence conservation. We demonstrate the preservation of a modular structure of the networks formed, and demonstrate that, within some of these modules, it is possible to observe a strong correlation between connectivity and essentiality or between connectivity and conservation within the modules particularly within modules containing larger numbers of essential genes.

CONCLUSION: Application of these techniques can allow a finer scale prediction of relative gene importance for a particular process within a group of similarly expressed genes.},

abstract = {THE MERGING OF NETWORK THEORY AND MICROARRAY DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES HAS SPAWNED A NEW FIELD: gene coexpression network analysis. While network methods are increasingly used in biology, the network vocabulary of computational biologists tends to be far more limited than that of, say, social network theorists. Here we review and propose several potentially useful network concepts. We take advantage of the relationship between network theory and the field of microarray data analysis to clarify the meaning of and the relationship among network concepts in gene coexpression networks. Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive concepts for describing the pairwise relationships among genes, which are depicted in cluster trees and heat maps. Conversely, microarray data analysis techniques (singular value decomposition, tests of differential expression) can also be used to address difficult problems in network theory. We describe conditions when a close relationship exists between network analysis and microarray data analysis techniques, and provide a rough dictionary for translating between the two fields. Using the angular interpretation of correlations, we provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and derive unexpected relationships among them. We use the singular value decomposition of module expression data to characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks, i.e., adjacency matrices that factor into node specific contributions. High and low level views of coexpression networks allow us to study the relationships among modules and among module genes, respectively. We characterize coexpression networks where hub genes are significant with respect to a microarray sample trait and show that the network concept of intramodular connectivity can be interpreted as a fuzzy measure of module membership. We illustrate our results using human, mouse, and yeast microarray gene expression data. The unification of coexpression network methods with traditional data mining methods can inform the application and development of systems biologic methods.},

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography-the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.},

abstract = {Systems-oriented genetic approaches that incorporate gene expression and genotype data are valuable in the quest for genetic regulatory loci underlying complex traits. Gene coexpression network analysis lends itself to identification of entire groups of differentially regulated genes-a highly relevant endeavor in finding the underpinnings of complex traits that are, by definition, polygenic in nature. Here we describe one such approach based on liver gene expression and genotype data from an F(2) mouse inter-cross utilizing weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of gene expression data to identify physiologically relevant modules. We describe two strategies: single-network analysis and differential network analysis. Single-network analysis reveals the presence of a physiologically interesting module that can be found in two distinct mouse crosses. Module quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) that perturb this module were discovered. In addition, we report a list of genetic drivers for this module. Differential network analysis reveals differences in connectivity and module structure between two networks based on the liver expression data of lean and obese mice. Functional annotation of these genes suggests a biological pathway involving epidermal growth factor (EGF). Our results demonstrate the utility of WGCNA in identifying genetic drivers and in finding genetic pathways represented by gene modules. These examples provide evidence that integration of network properties may well help chart the path across the gene-trait chasm.},

@article{Horvath2006,
abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor of adults and one of the most lethal of all cancers. Patients with this disease have a median survival of 15 months from the time of diagnosis despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. New treatment approaches are needed. Recent works suggest that glioblastoma patients may benefit from molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we address the compelling need for identification of new molecular targets. Leveraging global gene expression data from two independent sets of clinical tumor samples (n = 55 and n = 65), we identify a gene coexpression module in glioblastoma that is also present in breast cancer and significantly overlaps with the "metasignature" for undifferentiated cancer. Studies in an isogenic model system demonstrate that this module is downstream of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII, and that it can be inhibited by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib. We identify ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) as a key gene within this module and demonstrate its overexpression in glioblastoma relative to normal brain (or body tissues). Finally, we show that ASPM inhibition by siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibits tumor cell proliferation and neural stem cell proliferation, supporting ASPM as a potential molecular target in glioblastoma. Our weighted gene coexpression network analysis provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key control networks and molecular targets for glioblastoma, and the principle eluted from our work can be applied to other cancers.},

abstract = {Many association tests have been proposed for rare variants, but the choice of a powerful test is uncertain when there is limited information on the underlying genetic model. Proposed methods use either linear statistics, which are powerful when most variants are causal and have the same direction of effect, or quadratic statistics, which are more powerful in other scenarios. To achieve robustness, it is natural to combine the evidence of association from two or more complementary tests. To this end, we consider the minimum-p and Fisher's methods of combining P-values from linear and quadratic statistics. Extensive simulation studies show that both methods are robust across models with varying proportions of causal, deleterious, and protective rare variants, allele frequencies, and effect sizes. When the majority (>75\%) of the causal effects are in the same direction (deleterious or protective), Fisher's method consistently outperforms the minimum-p and the individual linear and quadratic tests, as well as the optimal sequence kernel association test, SKAT-O. When the individual test has moderate power, Fisher's test has improved power for 90\% of the \~{}5000 models considered, with >20\% relative efficiency gain for 40\% of the models. The maximum absolute power loss is 8\% for the remaining 10\% of the models. An application to the GAW17 quantitative trait Q2 data based on sequence data of the 1000 Genomes Project shows that, compared with linear and quadratic tests, Fisher's test has comparable power for all 13 functional genes and provides the best power for more than half of them.},

We identified modules of highly coexpressed genes, some of which are restricted to a single lineage but most of which are expressed at variable levels across multiple lineages. We found densely interconnected cis-regulatory circuits and a large number of transcription factors that are differentially expressed across hematopoietic states. These findings suggest a more complex regulatory system for hematopoiesis than previously assumed.},

To ensure validity of findings from network meta-analyses, the systematic review must be designed rigorously and conducted carefully. Aspects of designing and conducting a systematic review for network meta-analysis include defining the review question, specifying eligibility criteria, searching for and selecting studies, assessing risk of bias and quality of evidence, conducting a network meta-analysis, interpreting and reporting findings. This commentary summarizes the methodologic challenges and research opportunities for network meta-analysis relevant to each aspect of the systematic review process based on discussions at a network meta-analysis methodology meeting we hosted in May 2010 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since this commentary reflects the discussion at that meeting, it is not intended to provide an overview of the field.},

Patients included in this study represent four cytogenetically distinct subtypes of B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL and T-cell lineage ALL (T-ALL). The robustness of DGE combined with supervised classification by nearest shrunken centroids (NSC) was validated experimentally and by comparison with published expression data for large sets of ALL samples. Genes that were differentially expressed between BCP ALL subtypes were enriched to distinct signaling pathways with dic(9;20) enriched to TP53 signaling, t(9;22) to interferon signaling, as well as high hyperdiploidy and t(12;21) to apoptosis signaling. We also observed antisense tags expressed from the non-coding strand of \~{}50\% of annotated genes, many of which were expressed in a subtype-specific pattern. Antisense tags from 17 gene regions unambiguously discriminated between the BCP ALL and T-ALL subtypes, and antisense tags from 76 gene regions discriminated between the 4 BCP subtypes. We observed a significant overlap of gene regions with alternative polyadenylation and antisense transcription (P<1 × 10(-15)). Our study using DGE profiling provided new insights into the RNA expression patterns in ALL cells.},

abstract = {Which significance test is carried out when the number of repeats is small in microarray experiments can dramatically influence the results. When in two sample comparisons both conditions have fewer than, say, five repeats traditional test statistics require extreme results, before a gene is considered statistically significant differentially expressed after a multiple comparisons correction. In the literature many approaches to circumvent this problem have been proposed. Some of these proposals use (empirical) Bayes arguments to moderate the variance estimates for individual genes. Other proposals try to stabilize these variance estimate by combining groups of genes or similar experiments. In this paper we compare several of these approaches, both on data sets where both experimental conditions are the same, and thus few statistically significant differentially expressed genes should be identified, and on experiments where both conditions do differ. This allows us to identify which approaches are most powerful without identifying many false positives. We conclude that after balancing the numbers of false positives and true positives an empirical Bayes approach and an approach which combines experiments perform best. Standard t-tests are inferior and offer almost no power when the sample size is small.},

abstract = {While meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for analyzing microarray experiments by combining data from multiple studies, it presents unique computational challenges. The Bioconductor package RankProd provides a new and intuitive tool for this purpose in detecting differentially expressed genes under two experimental conditions. The package modifies and extends the rank product method proposed by Breitling et al., [(2004) FEBS Lett., 573, 83-92] to integrate multiple microarray studies from different laboratories and/or platforms. It offers several advantages over t-test based methods and accepts pre-processed expression datasets produced from a wide variety of platforms. The significance of the detection is assessed by a non-parametric permutation test, and the associated P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) are included in the output alongside the genes that are detected by user-defined criteria. A visualization plot is provided to view actual expression levels for each gene with estimated significance measurements. AVAILABILITY: RankProd is available at Bioconductor http://www.bioconductor.org. A web-based interface will soon be available at http://cactus.salk.edu/RankProd},

Various reverse engineering methods have been proposed in the literature, and it is important to understand their relative merits and shortcomings.

The evaluation is carried out on the Raf pathway, a cellular signalling network describing the interaction of 11 phosphorylated proteins and phospholipids in human immune system cells. We use both laboratory data from cytometry experiments as well as data simulated from the gold-standard network. We also compare passive observations with active interventions.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: We propose a beta-mixture model approach to solve a variety of problems related to correlations of gene-expression levels. For example, in meta-analyses of microarray gene-expression datasets, a threshold value of correlation coefficients for gene-expression levels is used to decide whether gene-expression levels are strongly correlated across studies. Ad hoc threshold values such as 0.5 are often used. In this paper, we use a beta-mixture model approach to divide the correlation coefficients into several populations so that the large correlation coefficients can be identified. Another important application of the proposed method is in finding co-expressed genes. Two examples are provided to illustrate both applications. Through our analysis, we also discover that the popular model selection criteria BIC and AIC are not suitable for the beta-mixture model. To determine the number of components in the mixture model, we suggest an alternative criterion, ICL-BIC, which is shown to perform better in selecting the correct mixture model.

abstract = {Gene co-expression network analysis is an effective method for predicting gene functions and disease biomarkers. However, few studies have systematically identified co-expressed genes involved in the molecular origin and development of various types of tumors. In this study, we used a network mining algorithm to identify tightly connected gene co-expression networks that are frequently present in microarray datasets from 33 types of cancer which were derived from 16 organs/tissues. We compared the results with networks found in multiple normal tissue types and discovered 18 tightly connected frequent networks in cancers, with highly enriched functions on cancer-related activities. Most networks identified also formed physically interacting networks. In contrast, only 6 networks were found in normal tissues, which were highly enriched for housekeeping functions. The largest cancer network contained many genes with genome stability maintenance functions. We tested 13 selected genes from this network for their involvement in genome maintenance using two cell-based assays. Among them, 10 were shown to be involved in either homology-directed DNA repair or centrosome duplication control including the well- known cancer marker MKI67. Our results suggest that the commonly recognized characteristics of cancers are supported by highly coordinated transcriptomic activities. This study also demonstrated that the co-expression network directed approach provides a powerful tool for understanding cancer physiology, predicting new gene functions, as well as providing new target candidates for cancer therapeutics.},

We show that reverse-engineering algorithms are indeed able to correctly infer regulatory interactions among genes, at least when one performs perturbation experiments complying with the algorithm requirements. These algorithms are superior to classic clustering algorithms for the purpose of finding regulatory interactions among genes, and, although further improvements are needed, have reached a discreet performance for being practically useful.},

Due to high dimensionality of gene expression data, however, there is a serious problem of collinearity in fitting a prediction model, e.g. Cox's proportional hazards model. To avoid the collinearity problem, several methods based on penalized Cox proportional hazards models have been proposed. However, those methods suffer from severe computational problems, such as slow or even failed convergence, because of high-dimensional matrix inversions required for model fitting. We propose to implement the penalized Cox regression with a lasso penalty via the gradient lasso algorithm that yields faster convergence to the global optimum than do other algorithms. Moreover the gradient lasso algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimum under mild regularity conditions. Hence, our gradient lasso algorithm can be a useful tool in developing a prediction model based on high-dimensional covariates including gene expression data.},

abstract = {Predicting at the time of discovery the prognosis and metastatic potential of cancer is a major challenge in current clinical research. Numerous recent studies searched for gene expression signatures that outperform traditionally used clinical parameters in outcome prediction. Finding such a signature will free many patients of the suffering and toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy given to them under current protocols, even though they do not need such treatment. A reliable set of predictive genes also will contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanism of metastasis. Several groups have published lists of predictive genes and reported good predictive performance based on them. However, the gene lists obtained for the same clinical types of patients by different groups differed widely and had only very few genes in common. This lack of agreement raised doubts about the reliability and robustness of the reported predictive gene lists, and the main source of the problem was shown to be the small number of samples that were used to generate the gene lists. Here, we introduce a previously undescribed mathematical method, probably approximately correct (PAC) sorting, for evaluating the robustness of such lists. We calculate for several published data sets the number of samples that are needed to achieve any desired level of reproducibility. For example, to achieve a typical overlap of 50\% between two predictive lists of genes, breast cancer studies would need the expression profiles of several thousand early discovery patients.},

abstract = {Microarray-based studies of global gene expression (GE) have resulted in a large amount of data that can be mined for further insights into disease and physiology. Meta-analysis of these data is hampered by technical limitations due to many different platforms, gene annotations and probes used in different studies. We tested the feasibility of conducting a meta-analysis of GE studies to determine a transcriptional signature of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. Data from studies that used normal bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors was integrated using both RefSeq and UniGene identifiers. We observed that in spite of variability introduced by experimental conditions and different microarray platforms, our meta-analytical approach can distinguish biologically distinct normal tissues by clustering them based on their cell of origin. When studied in terms of disease states, GE studies of leukemias and myelodysplasia progenitors tend to cluster with normal progenitors and remain distinct from other normal tissues, further validating the discriminatory power of this meta-analysis. Furthermore, analysis of 57 normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell GE samples was used to determine a gene expression signature characteristic of these cells. Genes that were most uniformly expressed in progenitors and at the same time differentially expressed when compared to other normal tissues were found to be involved in important biological processes such as cell cycle regulation and hematopoiesis. Validation studies using a different microarray platform demonstrated the enrichment of several genes such as SMARCE, Septin 6 and others not previously implicated in hematopoiesis. Most interestingly, alpha-integrin, the only common stemness gene discovered in a recent comparative murine analysis (Science 302(5644):393) was also enriched in our dataset, demonstrating the usefulness of this analytical approach.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Differentially expressed gene (DEG) lists detected from different microarray studies for a same disease are often highly inconsistent. Even in technical replicate tests using identical samples, DEG detection still shows very low reproducibility. It is often believed that current small microarray studies will largely introduce false discoveries. RESULTS: Based on a statistical model, we show that even in technical replicate tests using identical samples, it is highly likely that the selected DEG lists will be very inconsistent in the presence of small measurement variations. Therefore, the apparently low reproducibility of DEG detection from current technical replicate tests does not indicate low quality of microarray technology. We also demonstrate that heterogeneous biological variations existing in real cancer data will further reduce the overall reproducibility of DEG detection. Nevertheless, in small subsamples from both simulated and real data, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) for each DEG list tends to be low, suggesting that each separately determined list may comprise mostly true DEGs. Rather than simply counting the overlaps of the discovery lists from different studies for a complex disease, novel metrics are needed for evaluating the reproducibility of discoveries characterized with correlated molecular changes. Supplementaty information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of human genetics creates countless opportunities for studies of disease association. Given the number of potentially identifiable genetic markers and the multitude of clinical outcomes to which these may be linked, the testing and validation of statistical hypotheses in genetic epidemiology is a task of unprecedented scale. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative approach for combining the results of various studies on the same topic, and for estimating and explaining their diversity. Here, we have evaluated by meta-analysis 370 studies addressing 36 genetic associations for various outcomes of disease. We show that significant between-study heterogeneity (diversity) is frequent, and that the results of the first study correlate only modestly with subsequent research on the same association. The first study often suggests a stronger genetic effect than is found by subsequent studies. Both bias and genuine population diversity might explain why early association studies tend to overestimate the disease protection or predisposition conferred by a genetic polymorphism. We conclude that a systematic meta-analytic approach may assist in estimating population-wide effects of genetic risk factors in human disease.},

@article{Lim2007,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: An increasingly common application of gene expression profile data is the reverse engineering of cellular networks. However, common procedures to normalize expression profiles generated using the Affymetrix GeneChips technology were originally developed for a rather different purpose, namely the accurate measure of differential gene expression between two or more phenotypes. As a result, current evaluation strategies lack comprehensive metrics to assess the suitability of available normalization procedures for reverse engineering and, in general, for measuring correlation between the expression profiles of a gene pair. RESULTS: We benchmark four commonly used normalization procedures (MAS5, RMA, GCRMA and Li-Wong) in the context of established algorithms for the reverse engineering of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Replicate sample, randomized and human B-cell data sets are used as an input. Surprisingly, our study suggests that MAS5 provides the most faithful cellular network reconstruction. Furthermore, we identify a crucial step in GCRMA responsible for introducing severe artifacts in the data leading to a systematic overestimate of pairwise correlation. This has key implications not only for reverse engineering but also for other methods, such as hierarchical clustering, relying on accurate measurements of pairwise expression profile correlation. We propose an alternative implementation to eliminate such side effect.},

abstract = {Oligonucleotide microarrays are an informative tool to elucidate gene regulatory networks. In order for gene expression levels to be comparable across microarrays, normalization procedures have to be invoked. A large number of methods have been described to correct for systematic biases in microarray experiments. The performance of these methods has been tested only to a limited extend. Here, we evaluate two different types of microarray analyses: (i) the same gene in replicate samples and (ii) different, but co-expressed genes in the same sample. The reliability of the latter analysis needs to be determined for the analysis of regulatory networks and our report is the first attempt to evaluate for the accuracy of different microarray normalization methods in this respect. Consistent with previous results we observed a large effect of the normalization method on the outcome of the expression analyses. Our analyses indicate that different normalization methods should be performed depending on whether a study is aiming to detect differential gene expression between independent samples or whether co-expressed genes should be identified. We make recommendations about the most appropriate method to use.},

Age-standardized incidence rates were 24.5 (per 100,000) for LMs and 7.55 for MMs. The commonest LMs were plasma cell neoplasms (4.62), small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphatic leukemia (3.79), diffuse B-cell lymphoma (3.13), and Hodgkin lymphoma (2.41). The commonest MMs were acute myeloid leukemia (2.96), other myeloproliferative neoplasms (1.76), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1.24). Unknown morphology LMs were commonest in Northern Europe (7.53); unknown morphology MMs were commonest in Southern Europe (0.73). Overall incidence was lowest in Eastern Europe and lower in women than in men. For most LMs, incidence was highest in Southern Europe; for MMs incidence was highest in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Differences in diagnostic and registration criteria are an important cause of incidence variation; however, different distribution of HM risk factors also contributes. The quality of population-based HM data needs further improvement.},

An important and common question in microarray experiments is the identification of differentially expressed genes, i.e., genes whose expression levels are associated with a response or covariate of interest. The biological question of differential expression can be restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simul- taneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and the responses or covariates. As a typical microarray ex- periment measures expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, large multiplicity problems are generated.

Here, we describe a model of binding interactions on microarrays that reveals how probe signals depend on probe sequences and why certain probes are ineffective. The model indicates that the amount of nonspecific binding can be estimated from a simple rule. Using this model, we have developed an improved measure of gene expression for use in data analysis.},

abstract = {RNA-Seq has emerged as a revolutionary technology for transcriptome analysis. In this article, we report a systematic comparison of RNA-Seq and high-density exon array for detecting differential gene expression between closely related species. On a panel of human/chimpanzee/rhesus cerebellum RNA samples previously examined by the high-density human exon junction array (HJAY) and real-time qPCR, we generated 48.68 million RNA-Seq reads. Our results indicate that RNA-Seq has significantly improved gene coverage and increased sensitivity for differentially expressed genes compared with the high-density HJAY array. Meanwhile, we observed a systematic increase in the RNA-Seq error rate for lowly expressed genes. Specifically, between-species DEGs detected by array/qPCR but missed by RNA-Seq were characterized by relatively low expression levels, as indicated by lower RNA-Seq read counts, lower HJAY array expression indices and higher qPCR raw cycle threshold values. Furthermore, this issue was not unique to between-species comparisons of gene expression. In the RNA-Seq analysis of MicroArray Quality Control human reference RNA samples with extensive qPCR data, we also observed an increase in both the false-negative rate and the false-positive rate for lowly expressed genes. These findings have important implications for the design and data interpretation of RNA-Seq studies on gene expression differences between and within species.},

This pair of packages offers a tool to visualise very long one-dimensional data vectors (with up to billions of entries) in an efficient fashion that allows to get a quick impression of the spatial distribution and rough shape of the features present in the data. This is especially useful in the initial exploration of high-resolution position-dependent genomic data, such as tiling array or ChIP-Seq data.

abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).},

abstract = {Cell of origin classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) identifies subsets with biological and clinical significance. Despite the established nature of the classification existing studies display variability in classifier implementation, and a comparative analysis across multiple data sets is lacking. Here we describe the validation of a cell of origin classifier for DLBCL, based on balanced voting between 4 machine-learning tools: the DLBCL automatic classifier (DAC). This shows superior survival separation for assigned Activated B-cell (ABC) and Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL classes relative to a range of other classifiers. DAC is effective on data derived from multiple microarray platforms and formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples and is parsimonious, using 20 classifier genes. We use DAC to perform a comparative analysis of gene expression in 10 data sets (2030 cases). We generate ranked meta-profiles of genes showing consistent class-association using ≥6 data sets as a cut-off: ABC (414 genes) and GCB (415 genes). The transcription factor ZBTB32 emerges as the most consistent and differentially expressed gene in ABC-DLBCL while other transcription factors such as ARID3A, BATF, and TCF4 are also amongst the 24 genes associated with this class in all datasets. Analysis of enrichment of 12323 gene signatures against meta-profiles and all data sets individually confirms consistent associations with signatures of molecular pathways, chromosomal cytobands, and transcription factor binding sites. We provide DAC as an open access Windows application, and the accompanying meta-analyses as a resource.},

abstract = {We describe the use of a higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) in transforming a data tensor of genes x "x-settings," that is, different settings of the experimental variable x x "y-settings," which tabulates DNA microarray data from different studies, to a "core tensor" of "eigenarrays" x "x-eigengenes" x "y-eigengenes." Reformulating this multilinear HOSVD such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this HOSVD with an integration of genome-scale mRNA expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes YKU70, MRE11, AIF1, and ZWF1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression. A genome-scale correlation between DNA replication initiation and RNA transcription, which is equivalent to a recently discovered correlation and might be due to a previously unknown mechanism of regulation, is independently uncovered.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that are known to have critical functions across various biological processes. Simultaneous activities of multiple miRNAs can be monitored from their expression profiles under various conditions. We often build up coexpression networks from such profiles. Unfortunately, due to the change of experimental setups (or conditions), the expression profiles do change, and consequently, the patterns of the coexpression networks vary. To obtain a robust functional relationship between miRNAs, by integrating different coexpression networks in a systems biology approach, we have to combine them properly. Here, we evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques and propose a novel integrative measure, and a corresponding methodology, that might be useful for identifying the dependence between coexpression and functional similarity. We establish the results by evaluating the expression profiles of miRNAs taken from bone marrow samples of patients with leukemia. The findings highlight the potential of the integrative algorithm in analyzing the expression profiles of miRNAs for further study.},

abstract = {The rapid accumulation of biological networks poses new challenges and calls for powerful integrative analysis tools. Most existing methods capable of simultaneously analyzing a large number of networks were primarily designed for unweighted networks, and cannot easily be extended to weighted networks. However, it is known that transforming weighted into unweighted networks by dichotomizing the edges of weighted networks with a threshold generally leads to information loss. We have developed a novel, tensor-based computational framework for mining recurrent heavy subgraphs in a large set of massive weighted networks. Specifically, we formulate the recurrent heavy subgraph identification problem as a heavy 3D subtensor discovery problem with sparse constraints. We describe an effective approach to solving this problem by designing a multi-stage, convex relaxation protocol, and a non-uniform edge sampling technique. We applied our method to 130 co-expression networks, and identified 11,394 recurrent heavy subgraphs, grouped into 2,810 families. We demonstrated that the identified subgraphs represent meaningful biological modules by validating against a large set of compiled biological knowledge bases. We also showed that the likelihood for a heavy subgraph to be meaningful increases significantly with its recurrence in multiple networks, highlighting the importance of the integrative approach to biological network analysis. Moreover, our approach based on weighted graphs detects many patterns that would be overlooked using unweighted graphs. In addition, we identified a large number of modules that occur predominately under specific phenotypes. This analysis resulted in a genome-wide mapping of gene network modules onto the phenome. Finally, by comparing module activities across many datasets, we discovered high-order dynamic cooperativeness in protein complex networks and transcriptional regulatory networks.},

@article{Braun2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important emerging trend in the analysis of microarray data is to incorporate known pathway information a priori. Expression level "summaries" for pathways, obtained from the expression data for the genes constituting the pathway, permit the inclusion of pathway information, reduce the high dimensionality of microarray data, and have the power to elucidate gene-interaction dependencies which are not already accounted for through known pathway identification.

RESULTS: We present a novel method for the analysis of microarray data that identifies joint differential expression in gene-pathway pairs. This method takes advantage of known gene pathway memberships to compute a summary expression level for each pathway as a whole. Correlations between the pathway expression summary and the expression levels of genes not already known to be associated with the pathway provide clues to gene interaction dependencies that are not already accounted for through known pathway identification, and statistically significant differences between gene-pathway correlations in phenotypically different cells (e.g., where the expression level of a single gene and a given pathway summary correlate strongly in normal cells but weakly in tumor cells) may indicate biologically relevant gene-pathway interactions. Here, we detail the methodology and present the results of this method applied to two gene-expression datasets, identifying gene-pathway pairs which exhibit differential joint expression by phenotype.

CONCLUSION: The method described herein provides a means by which interactions between large numbers of genes may be identified by incorporating known pathway information to reduce the dimensionality of gene interactions. The method is efficient and easily applied to data sets of \~{}102 arrays. Application of this method to two publicly-available cancer data sets yields suggestive and promising results. This method has the potential to complement gene-at-a-time analysis techniques for microarray analysis by indicating relationships between pathways and genes that have not previously been identified and which may play a role in disease.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The most used criterion in microarray data analysis is nowadays the false discovery rate (FDR). In the framework of estimating procedures based on the marginal distribution of the P-values without any assumption on gene expression changes, estimators of the FDR are necessarily conservatively biased. Indeed, only an upper bound estimate can be obtained for the key quantity pi0, which is the probability for a gene to be unmodified. In this paper, we propose a novel family of estimators for pi0 that allows the calculation of FDR.

RESULTS: The very simple method for estimating pi0 called LBE (Location Based Estimator) is presented together with results on its variability. Simulation results indicate that the proposed estimator performs well in finite sample and has the best mean square error in most of the cases as compared with the procedures QVALUE, BUM and SPLOSH. The different procedures are then applied to real datasets.

AVAILABILITY: The R function LBE is available at http://ifr69.vjf.inserm.fr/lbe

abstract = {A problem in analyzing microarray-based gene expression data is the separation of genes causally involved in a disease from innocent bystander genes, whose expression levels have been secondarily altered by primary changes elsewhere. To investigate this issue systematically in the context of a class of complex human diseases, we have compared microarray-based gene expression data with non-microarray-based clinical and biological data about the schizophrenias to ask whether these two approaches prioritize the same genes. We find that genes whose expression changes are deemed to be of importance from microarrays are rarely those classified as of importance from clinical, in situ, molecular, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association, knockout and drug perturbation data. This disparity is not limited to the schizophrenias but characterizes other human disease data sets. It also extends to biological validation of microarray data in model organisms, in which genome-wide phenotypic data have been systematically compared with microarray data. In addition, different bioinformatic protocols applied to the same microarray data yield quite different gene sets and thus make clinical decisions less straightforward. We discuss how progress may be improved in the clinical area by the assignment of high-quality phenotypic values to each member of a microarray-assigned gene set.},

Microarrays epitomize this type of technology but similar problems arise in proteomics, time of flight spectroscopy, flow cytometry, FMRI imaging, and massive social science surveys. This paper uses local false discovery rate methods to carry out size and power calculations on large-scale data sets. An empirical Bayes approach allows the fdr analysis to proceed from a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling assumptions. Microarray and simulated data sets are used to illustrate a convenient estimation methodology whose accuracy can be calculated in closed form. A crucial part of the methodology is an fdr assessment of “thinned counts”, what the histogram of test statistics would look like for just the non-null cases.},

abstract = {To classify cancer specimens by their gene expression profiles, we created a statistical method based on Bayes' rule that estimates the probability of membership in one of two cancer subgroups. We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68-74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P < or = 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},
